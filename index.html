    <p><br>My hobby is dancing....I like to create different steps and different ways of dance,sometimes i would mix up my dance like classical, western, hip-hop etc everything together and form up a new style.Dance means almost finding like a new person inside you.....It makes me feel very happy.<br><br>When i dance i forget everything and became very happy and joyful and concentrate on my steps....While dancing we can create several ways of dance,create different steps, to make our dance more presentable.Practice certainly makes a person skilled in any field and this holds good for dance too. It is important to dedicate some time for practice as certain steps require practice.Dance is not a thing that will become perfect with one or two try,you need to practice and practice and it will become perfect.....<br><br>Always try until you Succeed.......<br></p>
